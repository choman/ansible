# To do

  - test vbox install on fresh machine
  - add user to vbox and libvirt groups
  - install vbox extensions
  - install docker

# ansible pull

to properly maintain git logs, learn how to test locally.. That way 
a branch can be created item tested thoroughly, then merged into the 
master branch.

NOTE: current doesn't work, maybe add -f?
